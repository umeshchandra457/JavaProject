ProjectStartView.java is the main class to start the execution.

I have created 2 packges.
1. business components
2. visible components

Visiblecomponents packge is dediated to contain the swing elements used to make the UI.
businesscomponents package is the one to make the end to end business logic.

User is differentiated at Authentication.
User object contains the attributes ( isAdmin , isFaculty, isStudent) to understand if the loggedInUser type.

Student can register.
With those credentials he can immdiately login to the system.

Faculty member will be created by SuperAdmin.
He can see all student details and other stuff related to the college.

A SuperAdmin can do all admin related operations including
creating a new branch, add students marks, add student fee details, exam/assignment schedule are part of SuperAdmin.
